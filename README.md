# LGBIO2072-2020

Outline for the tutorials

TP1 - 2 hours
- Implement the LIF
- Try different input currents
- Computes the firing rate + ISI (and histograms)
Goal: 	Learn how to compute firing rates and ISI intervals on real data
	Be able to produce and interpret raster plots
-> Looking at one neuron is good but how can we try to understand behaviour based on a large amount of neurons . 

TP2 - 2 hours
- Interpret and understand the differential equations representing our system with 2 population of neurons
- Discretize and implement the equations
- Add input current to the system
- Decision making:  Speed and accuracy tradeoff
- Winner takes all
Goal:  How to interpret firing rates of a large number of neurons.

TP3 - 3 hours + 1 hour kickoff project
- Model formulation
- Cost function 
- Control
- Kalman
Goal: Have the intuition for the LQG and kick off for the project
